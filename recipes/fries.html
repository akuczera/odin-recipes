    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Parsnips don’t get much love, and we think that should change. Perhaps this recipe will convince you to give them a try!
        <p>Why we love them as fries: They’re crispy on the outside, tender
        on the inside, cook really fast, and have the texture of a sweet
        potato fry with the taste of a potato-carrot hybrid (so good,
        right?). And when tossed in a bit of oil, salt, and our go-to
        vibrant curry powder, the flavors are perfectly balanced. Plus,
        they’re quick and easy to prepare — just 5 ingredients, 1 pan, and
        30 minutes required! Let us show you how it’s done!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large Parsnips</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp avocado oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 F (218 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (use more baking sheets if making a larger batch).</li>
            <li>Add your parsnip “fries” to the prepared baking sheet and top with avocado oil, sea salt, black pepper, and curry powder. Toss to evenly coat.</li>
            <li>Spread into an even layer and ensure they aren’t touching to allow for proper browning (if you have fries that didn’t fit, add to a separate lined baking sheet).</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and toss/flip. Return to oven and bake for 5-8 minutes more, or until browned on the edges and slightly crisp. The longer they bake, the more golden and crispy they will become.</li>
            <li>Serve as is, or with Liquid Gold Sauce, Avocado Aioli,
            No-Honey Mustard Sauce, or Zesty Dill Yogurt Sauce.</li>
            <li>Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days. Reheat in a 350 F (176 C) oven or on the stovetop over medium heat until hot. Not freezer friendly.</li>
        </ol>
