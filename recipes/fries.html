    <h1>Curry Roasted Parsnip Fries</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Parsnips don’t get much love, and we think that should change. Perhaps this recipe will convince you to give them a try!
    <p>Why we love them as fries: They’re crispy on the outside, tender
    on the inside, cook really fast, and have the texture of a sweet
    potato fry with the taste of a potato-carrot hybrid (so good,
    right?). And when tossed in a bit of oil, salt, and our go-to
    vibrant curry powder, the flavors are perfectly balanced. Plus,
    they’re quick and easy to prepare — just 5 ingredients, 1 pan, and
    30 minutes required! Let us show you how it’s done!</p>
